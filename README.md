# Final-Graphics
Welcome to the Readme.
This project was supposed to be contained within a single .zip, but the file size was too big.  Most of the necessary files, aside from the OpenGl files, should be here.

The following are the journal questions for the assignment:

1)How do I approach designing software?
  My personal approach is very heavily stepped in concepts like recursion, sub-classes, looping, and so on.  Anywhere I can write a method, class, header, or object that I can use and recycle is something I seek to maximize, as it tends to make the code more efficient.
  
  a) What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This project has greatly enhanced my understanding of the use of matrix algebra, as well as spacial awareness in a 3D space.
  
  b) What design process did you follow for your project work?
  We built everything modularly, milestone after milestone.  Slowly building a project like this is an effective method to minimize debugging, rather than jamming out thousands of lines of code at a go.
  
  c) How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  The modular building approach can be used in any project, not just graphics projects.  It minimizes debugging and ensures mastery of all necessary steps.
  
2)How do I approach developing programs?
  The approach is the same, a modular build relying heavily on concepts like recursion, inheritance, subclasses, and the like.
  
  a) What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  In previous projects, it was less common for me to build other files (like headers) to handle functions like camera movement.  Typically, I would build sub-classes to contain object definitions and related modification functions.  Containing global functions like camera placement in a separate file was new to me.
  
  b) How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration allowed us to steadily add to the complexity of what we were doing.  First, render a pyramid.  Then, change the angles, resize, etc.  Now, make the object move.  Now, make the camera move based on input.  We steadily layered in more and more features.
  
  c) How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  I gained a varied understanding of how objects were rendered, and different methods for drawing triangles.
  
3)How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Considering my goal is a career in the field, computer science is the only pathway to achieve it.  While I prefer management to raw coding, I am capable of either, and with this course, have added to my skillset.
  
  a) How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  To be honest, I'm not certain.  I do not know if I will be delving into graphics anymore in classes, but I will have a fighting chance due to the lessons here if I do.
  
  b) How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  This is dependant on where I end up.  There are a number of entry-level Scrum Master positions available in my area, and, depending on the software developed by the company, if I take that position, and graphics is involved, I will be a more effective leader if I can guide those I am supposed to help.  I've always believed the best leaders come from people who understand what their followers are doing, i.e., the best shop supervisors are trained mechanics, the best generals were sodliers first, and so on.  This concept applies to all fields.
